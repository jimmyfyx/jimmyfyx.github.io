## Soccer ⚽

Aside from work, I'm a huge fan of soccer. Starting to play soccer around 6-years old, I was intermittently under unprofessional training at Shenzhen Easy Strikers Football Club (F.C. SES) for about 3 years, coached by a team of expert coaches holding UEFA B licence. During the time I spent in Shenzhen, China, the city where I was born and raised, I've attended several intramural tournaments, wining one championship trophy and one second place both as a key player. In college, I kept attending the intramural tournament and making soccer as my primary hobby. 

[Chelsea F.C.](https://www.chelseafc.com/en) has been my favorite club for about 10 years (Let's connect if you're also a Chelsea fan 😉). Chelsea's spirit of never giving up is the reason I fell in love with it. 

My favorite video game is also about soccer, which is FIFA (renamed to EA Sports FC). I have 4 years of experience playing it, while earlier I played Pro Evolution Soccer (renamed to eFootball).
