I'm a second-year M.S./Ph.D. student at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) under the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) department. Currently, I'm a member of the [Human-Centered Autonomy Lab](https://thehcalab.web.illinois.edu/) advised by [Prof. Katie Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu/).

Before attending graduate school, I obtained my bachelor's degree also at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Computer Science.

In my academic journey, I specialize in developing algorithms to enhance the spatial awareness and decision-making abilities of autonomous systems to safely navigate in dynamic and unstructured environments. Topics I'm interested in include but not limited to:

- **Safe Autonomy**
- **Machine Perception, Computer Vision**
- **Real-to-Sim and Sim-to-Real in robotics**

In industry, I had spent time at [Zoox Inc.](https://zoox.com/), honorably supervised by [Eric Schafer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-schafer-1636853) and [Phillipe Burlina](https://resvirtualis.github.io/) to work on generative sensor simulation for autonomous vehicles. Earlier, I was at [LifeFoundry Inc.](https://www.life-foundry.com/), working on real-time vision-based perception system for AGVs. 

Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you're interested. I'm always excited to connect with others in robotics, AI, and tech innovation!
