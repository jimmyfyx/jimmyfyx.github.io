I'm a second-year M.S./Ph.D. student at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) under the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) department. Currently, I'm a member of the [Human-Centered Autonomy Lab](https://thehcalab.web.illinois.edu/) advised by [Prof. Katie Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu/). 

Before attending graduate school, I obtained my bachelor's degree also at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Computer Science.

In my academic journey, I specialize in developing algorithms to improve the spatial awareness and decision-making abilities of autonomous systems for safety purposes. My reserach interests include:

- **Safe Autonomy**
- **Machine Perception, Computer Vision** 
- **Real-to-Sim and Sim-to-Real in robotics**

In terms of industry experience, I've gained hands-on experience in robotic systems, especially perception systems design. At [LifeFoundry Inc.](https://www.life-foundry.com/), I worked on projects that involve real-time robot agent communication, image classification & processing, and vision-based control based on accurate pose estimation. Recently, I worked on 3D sensor simulation at [Zoox Inc.](https://zoox.com/).

Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you're interested. I'm always excited to connect with others in robotics, AI, and tech innovation!
